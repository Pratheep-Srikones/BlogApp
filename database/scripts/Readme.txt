Database Setup
Creating and Seeding the Database
Create the Database Schema:
Run the create_tables.sql script to set up the database schema. This script creates the necessary tables for the application.

Inserting Sample Data:
Recommended Method: Use the web application's user registration functionality to create user accounts and populate the database. This ensures that the data is inserted correctly and includes any additional setup that may be required by the application.
Alternative Method(NOT RECOMMENDED): If necessary, you can also use the insert_data.sql script to insert sample data directly into the database. This method is less preferred as it bypasses any application-specific setup or validation.
